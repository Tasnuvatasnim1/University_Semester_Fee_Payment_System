# University_Semester_Fee_Payment_System
A university semester fee payment system or payment slip is basically a small paper form which a student includes while depositing money for semester fee. A payment slip mostly consists of the name of the student, student id, total amount of money to be deposited and name of the suggested banks where the money can be paid. The details in a payment slip must be filled up before submission for a successful transaction. The payment slip serves as a proof that the bank and the university acknowledges receiving money from the student. Payment slips provide security to the bank, the university and the student. For the student and the university, it is an evidence of payment and also works as a receipt. On the other hand, it works as a record of deposited funds on a daily basis for the bank. This also works as a future reference if any kind of confusion occurs.
